This assignment, uses the RMarkdown template, 
`lab_02_report.Rmd`, which has exercises
for downloading climate data from the internet and using various tools from the
`tidyverse` package to manipulate the data, analyze it, and plot it.
We will spend most of lab working through these exercises, and you will finish
it at home.

The file _lab_02_worked_examples.Rmd` has worked examples of the kind of code
you will be using in this lab for downloading data from the internet and 
analyzing it using R.

This repository includes both printable instructions in PDF files
([`lab_02_report.pdf`]('lab_02_report.pdf')
and 
[`lab_02_worked_examples.pdf`]('lab_02_worked_examples.pdf')
) 
and Markdown versions that you can read online on
GitHub ([`lab_02_report.md`](lab_02_report.md)
and 
[`lab_02_worked_examples.md`](lab_02_worked_examples.md)).

## Instructions:

* Clone a local copy of the repository for this assignment from GitHub.
* In your local repository, answer the exercises in the templates
  `lab_02_report.Rmd`.
* When you are done, knit your `.Rmd` files into PDF files.
* Use Git to commit your changes (including the edits to the `.Rmd` files
  and the new PDF or Word files) to your local Git repository.
* Push the changes from your local Git repository to GitHub.

**I advise using Git to commit changes frequently as you work and push those 
commits to GitHub.** 

**I also advise knitting your work frequently** to make sure that you don't 
have errors that will mess up the RMarkdown formatting.

**Remember that to turn in the assignment you need to:**

1. Successfully **knit** `lab_02_report.Rmd` into a `.pdf` or 
   Word (`.docx`) file. 
2. **Commit** your `.Rmd` (rmarkdown) document **and** the `.pdf` or `.docx` 
   file to your local git repository on your computer.
3. **Push** your local repository to GitHub, so we
   can see your final results.

**The last version of your work that you have pushed by the deadline is what will be graded.**
You will lose a lot of points if there is not a `.pdf` or `.docx` file with 
results.

As long as there is a knitted file with results, we will be generous with 
partial credit.
